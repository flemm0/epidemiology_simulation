In this lab, we will model the effects of vaccination on how a disease spreads through a population.  The model will necessarily be a simplification of reality, but it will capture at least one of the key effects of vaccination on disease transmission.  The basic idea is to represent individuals in a population as points on a 2-dimensional grid.  Some fraction of the population will be vaccinated and some fraction will not (these are susceptible individuals).  You will start the disease in one susceptible individual and  track how it spreads from this initial infection.  Instead of starting to work directly on the entire program, we will guide you to develop the necessary components as individual stand-alone functions that you can then make use of in building the simulation. Do not try to program the whole simulation at once!  Doing so is a recipe for frustration.  Instead, work on the exercises we lay out and only think about putting them together once you have these pieces built and working.
