# Epidemiology Modeling
This project models the effects of vaccination on how a disease spreads through a population. While a simplification of reality, but the model captures at least one of the key effects of vaccination on disease transmission. The basic idea is to represent individuals in a population as points on a 2-dimensional grid. Some fraction of the population will be vaccinated and some fraction will not, and for the purposes of this model will be considered to be susceptible to infection. The disease will begin in one susceptible individual and spread throughout the population from this initial infection. 

One of the key things I have learned in completing this project was how to work with 2-dimensional data in R. Additionally, the use of test cases with each step was crucial to ensuring the program works as a whole.
